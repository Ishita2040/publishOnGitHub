        <p class="work3">This was a cover created for my publication, HUE. To make it appear like one human face, we combined three separate faces into one frame using Photoshop. As it was my first time using a software, the process was challenging. Nevertheless, the goal of doing a cover like this was to try to create something novel.</p>
